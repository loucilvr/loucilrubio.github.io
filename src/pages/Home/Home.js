            I'm a <strong> UX Engineer</strong> obsessed with understanding and
            solving usersâ€™ problems through user research, design and software
            development. I'm currently designing, building and deploying
            software at J.P. Morgan Chase, located in Tampa, FL.
            <br />
            <br />
            This unique role I'm in now means I get to do both of the things
            that I love and that is front end development and UI/UX design. So
            on some days, I'm gathering user requirements, creating
            high-fidelity designs on Sketch/Invision for our client-facing and
            internal applications, or demoing and gathering feedback from
            Product, tech and users. And on other days, I'm building UI components in
            React, integrating screens with API services, mentoring other
            engineers and shipping features into Production.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of work, you'll find me painting, drawing, baking, playing
            with my dog or practicing latte art. I built this portfolio to share
            some of my interests and showcase things I've created outside of
            work for fun :-)
